== Introduction

This is a very small, yet surprisingly complete, example of using
Clojure to serve up a RESTful API. It uses a variety of technologies
to demonstrate how this is possible. The project offers a full CRUD
(Create, Read, Update and Delete) experience over some Star Trek
starships!

== Features

* CRUD Functionality
* Exception Handling
* Internationalisation (i18n)
* Swagger API
* Input Validation (using https://github.com/metosin/malli[Malli])

=== Star Trek

This backend is written in Clojure and uses a PostgreSQL database to
store a list of starships. The technologies in play include:

* https://github.com/metosin/reitit[reitit]
* https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc[next-jdbc]
* https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql[honeysql (v2)]
* https://github.com/donut-power/system[donut.system]
* https://github.com/juxt/aero[juxt aero]
* https://github.com/flyway/flyway[flyway database migration]

A full list of the technologies that are used can be found in the
`deps.edn` file.

This service also exposes
https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/[Prometheus] metrics
*AND* a JMX endpoint for your enjoyment!

=== Star Trek UI

A companion project is available on
https://github.com/dharrigan/startrek-ui[github] that exposes a UI
written in https://clojurescript.org/[ClojureScript]. It's highly
recommended that you look at that project too and see if you can get
them both working together! ðŸ˜€

=== Engage!

There are at least 3 ways to launch this project:

==== Option 1

IMPORTANT: You need to copy the `resources/config/config-example.edn`
to `resources/config/config-local.edn` and modify, for example, if you
are connecting to your own PostgreSQL instance.

Fire up your repl using:

* `clj -M:dev`

to load up the `dev` alias defined in the `deps.edn` then

* `(dev/go)`

to start the system.

==== Option 2

IMPORTANT: You need to copy the `resources/config/config-example.edn`
to `resources/config/config-local.edn` and modify, for example, if you
are connecting to your own PostgreSQL instance.

IMPORTANT: If you want to use the `.justfile`, you'll need
https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/justfile[just] installed.
It's great btw!

* `just run-local`

or

* `bin/build`
* `bin/run-local`

==== Option 3

IMPORTANT: You don't need to copy any config file, as the docker
container is configured to use `config/config-example.edn`, and thus
this is the one by the application.

IMPORTANT: If you want to use the `.justfile`, you'll need
https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/justfile[just] installed.
It's great btw!

* `just run-docker`

or

* `bin/build`
* `bin/run-docker`
